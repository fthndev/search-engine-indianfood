      "TranslatedInstructions": "We begin making the Chocolate Tart Recipe by following the below procedures:Method for making the tart crustIn a large mixing bowl; combine the flour, sugar, and salt.\nAdd the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nAdd in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it.\nMake sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough.\nWrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface.\nRoll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick.\nLift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan.\nIt is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring.\nRemove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan.\nPlace the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes.\nThis process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C.\nOnce the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven.\nCover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes.\nThe tart will look golden brown but not completely baked.\nRemove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully.\nKeep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through.\nTurn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat.\nAdd in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined.\nThe chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy.\nIf you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven.\nIt is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely.\nRefrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.",

      "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Baklava Recipe (Turkish Traditional Sweet), we first have to make sure we have all the ingredients ready.Baklava Recipe procedure is split into 4 parts.Method to prepare the fillingCoarsely chop the walnuts and pistachios in a food processor (it will be a coarse powder).\nSet aside 4 tablespoons of chopped nuts for decoration.Put the remainder in a bowl and combine it with 1/3 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cloves and mix well.Method to assemble and bake the baklavaHeat the oven to 170 C.\nLay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water.\nThaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturer’s instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel.\nWhen unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic.\nThey are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan.\nBrush a baking pan with melted butter.\nTake a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter.\nDo the same with the third of the sheets.\nOnce 1/3rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides.\nThen sprinkle the remaining half of the nut mixture evenly.Layer the last third of the sheets, buttering them and pressing them the same way as we did with the previous layers.\nBrush the top most layer thoroughly with butter and pour any remainder of butter on the top (I ignored the last step.\nI did not pour the remaining butter.\nI just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 1/2-inch deep to mark out the shape.\nDo not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15 minutes (It took me exactly 1 hr) until golden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally.\nPour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer).\nThis process takes about 30  minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup.\nLet it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature.\nNow add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chef’s knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan.\nLet the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.",

      "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Spicy Neer Dosa Recipe; we will first soak the rice in completely immersed in water for at least 3 hours.Once the rice is soaked well, drain out the water.\nGrind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter.\nIt is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter.\nWhen you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl.\nAdd enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency.\nThe consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating.\nIf if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water.\nGrind the whole spices - Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Methi Seeds and Dried Red Chillies as well to a smooth paste by adding some water and add into the batter.Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made.\nThe Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa.\nWe pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan.\nGrease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot.\nWhen you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges.\nThe batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself.\nFill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes.\nThere is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour.\nThe cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle.\nPlace the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosa’s away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.\nOnce they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Spicy Neer Dosa Recipe along with kori gassi Recipe,Bean Sprout & Corn Salad Recipe by the side.",

      "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Kesar Pista Kulfi, we will first have to condense the milk.\nFor this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity.\nIt is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste.\nBurning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely.\nFinally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely.\nPour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator.\nThe Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.\n If you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the Kulfis.Once frozen you can run the kesar pista kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.Serve the Kesar Pista Kulfi for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties.\nYou can also serve it to your guests during festival with some delicious appetisers like Paneer Tikka and Chaat items.",

      "TranslatedInstructions": "To begin making the Kathal Biryani Recipe, let us first cut the raw jackfruit.\nIn order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.\nKeep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.To make rice for the Kathal Biryani : Wash and soak rice in water for 30 mins before you start cooking.In a heavy bottomed vessel, heat water-twice the quantity of the rice.\nAdd few drops of ghee, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt and some star anise in it.As soon as the water starts boiling, add rice and cook till 80% done.Once the rice is semi cooked to 80%, pass it through a strainer and collect the rice in a large tray and spread well so that they don't stick to each other.*To make kathal ki yakhniHeat ghee in a wok and fry the kathal pieces till brown in color.\nKeep aside.In the same wok, fry cashews, raisins that will be used for garish at the end.\nCollect them in separate bowls and keep aside.Now add all the whole spices along with bay leaf in the remaining ghee.\nAllow them to sizzle.Next add ginger and garlic and saute till light brown in color.At this stage, add finely chopped onions,fry till raw smell goes off and it turns golden in color.\nAdd green chilies and mix well.Once the onions are cooked, add the fried kathal pieces and yogurt and mix everything nicely so that the curd mixes well with the kathal.Soon you will observe, yogurt will start releasing water.\nCook till oil starts oozing out and yogurt starts drying up.To this, add red chili powder, coriander powder and some torn leaves of mint and coriander and fry till oil starts leaving from the sides.\nAdd salt and give it a good stir.\nTurn off the flame.\nTo assemble  Kathal Biryani  :Heat a flat base iron tawa on the gas and place a large thick bottomed utensil (handi/bhagona) on the tawa in which you wish to dum the biryani.Take 1 tablespoon of yogurt and spread it all over the base-this prevents yakhni from getting burnt.Spread the kathal yakhni all over the curd and make sure it's evenly spread on the base.Add some ghee over it and start covering it with layers of rice and caramelised onions.\nOnce you have covered the yakhni with the rice, pour saffron milk at one corner of the rice top.Squeeze lemon all over, add lots of chopped coriander and mint on top along with fried raisins and cashews-save few to garnish before serving.Cover the vessel with aluminium foil and seal it from the sides.Place the lid of the vessel on top of the foil and keep a heavy vessel over it so that the aroma is intact and the Kathal Biryani cooks well in dum.\nSimmer the gas and let the Kathal Biryani cook on dum for 20 minutes.Once the Kathal Biryani is done, remove the foil carefully and mix well by shaking the vessel.\nBy doing this the yakhni mixes well with the rice without breaking the grains.\nServe the Kathal Biryani as a one dish meal for a weeknight dinner or as a party food along with Sweet & Spicy Coriander Tadka Raita and Mirchi Ka Salan Recipe for a sumptuous meal.",
